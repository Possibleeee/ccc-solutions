**Python CCC Solutions and Lessons**

Welcome to the repository for my Python solutions to the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) problems and lessons. This repository serves as a resource for anyone preparing for the CCC or looking to improve their problem-solving skills in Python.

There will be some fun side stuff I made while learning from completing the CCC problems, you can take a look if you want :)
